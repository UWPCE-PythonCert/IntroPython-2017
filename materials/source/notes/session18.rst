Last Week
=========

Last week, Andy talked about relational databases, and provided examples using the Pee Wee ORM.

Did any of you put a DB (of any sort) behind your mailroom program?

Or use one for your personal project?

Any questions?

Should we do a little code review?

Today
=====

Today we'll be talking about NoSQL databases -- or other ways to work with large collections of data.

Lot to cover, so we have a choice:

1) Spend some time on code review of some of your work -- we promised that.

  - which means we'll probably leave some of the NoSQL material for you to study up on your own.

2) Get right into the the new material!
