Individual Project
==================

I hope you've all got a start on an individual project:

:ref:`individual_project`

It is due the Sunday after the last class: March 18.

You can turn it in via:

* A gitHub PR in the class repo
* Emailing us a link to a gitHub (or other) repo
* Emailing us a zip file of the code

We have to get your "grades" in soon, so we'll just make sure you've done something, and then reveiew it over teh next week or so.

Any questions about the project?

Shall we review some code?


Last Class
==========

Next week (March 13th) is the last class -- Chris will be out of town, and Maria will talk about profiling and performance.
