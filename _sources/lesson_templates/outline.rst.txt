Target/Alternate Outline
########################

The current outline is reflected in source/index.rst. This document is a target outline which was pulled in from a shared google doc.

For discussion and rebalancing.

Orientation
===========

Development environment setup and configuration.

#####################
Py 1: Intro to Python
#####################

Session 1-01
============

1.  Python Overview: What is Python and what are its major features?
2.  Python Language Primitives: data types, basic flow control.
3.  Introduction to source control: Basic git.

Session 1-02
============

Organizing your Programs

1.  Truthiness
2.  If .. elif .. else
3.  Ternary Expressions
4.  Functions
5.  Modules and Namespaces

Session 1-03
============

Sequences, Slicing and Iteration

1.  Lists, Tuples, Strings
2.  Slicing
3.  Iteration
4.  String methods
5.  String formatting

Session 1-04
============

Collections and I/O

1. Dictionaries
2. Sets
3. Files (probably a good place to introduce context managers from a client perspective, but not a server perspective if you know what I mean)

Session 1-05
============

1.  Exceptions
2.  Basic Unit testing: pytest
3.  Advanced Argument Passing
4.  Functions as first class language constructs: passing functions to functions

Session 1-06
============

Intro to Object Oriented Programming

1.  The Python Object Model
2.  Classes
3.  Attributes and Methods
4.  Single Inheritance
5.  Composition vs Sub-Classing

Session 1-07
============

Object Oriented Programming Continued

1.  Properties
2.  Introduction to special methods, i.e., the Dunders.

Session 1-08
============

Advanced Object Oriented Programming

1.  Static Methods
2.  Class Methods
3.  Multiple Inheritance
4.  Protocols
5.  Emulating standard types by overriding special methods

Session 1-09
============

Intro to Functional Programming

1.  Object Objected Programming vs Functional Programming
2.  Objects vs Functions
3.  Control Flow vs Data Flow
4.  Mutability vs Immutability
5.  Managing State
6.  Statements vs Expressions for flow control
7.  Map/filter/reduce

Session 1-10
============

Functional Programming Continued

1.  Comprehensions
2.  Anonymous Functions: Lambda
3.  Closures and Currying

#####################
PY 2: Advanced Python
#####################

Session 2-01
============

Advanced Functional Programming

1.  Functools
2.  Itertools
3.  Generators

Session 2-02
============

Advanced Python Language Constructs (made easy-ish)

1.  Decorators
2.  Context Managers
3.  Meta Programming
4.  Meta Classes

AT THIS POINT WE’RE FINALLY DONE WITH THE CORE OF THE LANGUAGE AND WE’RE MOVING ON TO HOW TO WORK EFFECTIVELY IN PYTHON’S ECOSYSTEM. THIS IS STUFF THAT WOULD FORMERLY HAVE GONE INTO “SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON” AKA PY300. THIS IS A MUCH BETTER LAYOUT THAN INSERTING THE FORMER PY200/WEBDEV CLASS INTO THIS CONCEPTUAL STREAM.

Session 2-03
============

Debugging & Logging

1.  Logging module
2.  Syslog
3.  pdb/ipdb
4.  PyCharm’s debugger

Session 2-04
============

Advanced Testing

2.  Coverage
3.  Fixtures

5.  Hypothesis

Session 2-05
============

Relational Databases

2.  ORMs
3.  Normalization
4.  Schema
5.  Sqlite
6.  Postgresql

Session 2-06
============

Object/Document, Key/Value and Graph Databases

1.  Schema vs “Schemaless”
2.  No-Sql
3.  Mongo
4.  Redis
5.  Neo4j

Session 2-07
============

Profiling & Performance

4.  Async
5.  Celery

Sessions 2-09 & 2-10
====================
