2. Basic Python and Functions
=============================

In this lesson, we introduce enough Python to get some real work done. You will become comfortable with names and values, the basic Python data types (numbers, and strings), do basic logic, and write functions to create modular code.

Learning objectives
-------------------

After completing this lesson, students will:

 1. Develop and run a simple Python program using their preferred editor.
 2. Name, create and use variables in a Python program.
 3. Use and demonstrate Python constructs to control program flow.
 4. Write basic Python functions and show how they are used in simple scenarios.

Tutorials
.........

Tutorials come in many forms, but I define a Python "tutorial" as a quick high-level introduction, designed to kick start your Python programming. It should give you enough to get something done, but not provide a lot of detailed explanations.  If you have been doing a bit of Python coding already, or have taken an introductory programing class with Python, then you may be able to skip this step.

Every one of you has a different background and learning style. So take whatever time you need to figure out which resource works for you.

:ref:`python_learning_resources`

.. https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/references/learning.html

Provides some options. Do look it over.

Python Basics
..............

If you are comfortable with the materials in a tutorial, it's time for some more in-depth discussion. Here are a few options to get you started:

:ref:`basic_python_syntax`

.. https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/BasicPython.html#basic-python-syntax

:ref:`more_on_functions`

.. https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/Functions.html#more-on-functions

:ref:`documentation`

.. https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/modules/Documentation.html#documentation

Supplemental Readings
.....................

If that is too fast, then here are some good options for another look:

*Think Python:* Chapters 1–6 (http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)

*Dive Into Python:* Chapters 1–2 (http://www.diveintopython3.net/)

*LPTHW:* ex. 1–10, 18-21 (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

(note: LPTHW used to be totally free --now it looks like you may only get a sneak peak -- darn! -- but the first few "chapters" are available)

This is a great chance to go back and make sure you've got your development environment set up well -- in particular your editor!
