File Reading and Writing
########################

Saving and loading data.


Files
=====

Text Files
----------

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.txt')
    secret_data = f.read()
    f.close()

``secret_data`` is a string

NOTE: these days, you probably need to use Unicode for text -- we'll get to that later...


Binary Files
------------

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.bin', 'rb')
    secret_data = f.read()
    f.close()

``secret_data`` is a byte string (with arbitrary bytes in it -- well, not arbitrary -- whatever is in the file!)

(See the ``struct``  module to unpack binary data )


File Opening Modes
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.txt', [mode])
    'r', 'w', 'a'
    'rb', 'wb', 'ab'
    r+, w+, a+
    r+b, w+b, a+b


These follow the Unix conventions, and aren't all that well documented
in the Python docs. But these BSD docs make it pretty clear:

http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/fopen/

**Gotcha** -- 'w' modes always clear the file.

Text File Notes
---------------

Text is default:

  * Newlines are translated: ``\r\n -> \n``
  *   -- reading and writing!
  * Use \*nix-style in your code: ``\n``


Gotcha:

  * no difference between text and binary on \*nix
  * but this is not true on Windows, and will cause an error.


File Reading
------------

Reading part of a file:

.. code-block:: python

    header_size = 4096
    f = open('secrets.txt')
    secret_header = f.read(header_size)
    secret_rest = f.read()
    f.close()


Common Idioms
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    for line in open('secrets.txt'):
        print(line)

(the file object is an iterator!)

.. code-block:: python

    f = open('secrets.txt')
    while True:
        line = f.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        do_something_with_line()


We will learn more about the keyword with later, but for now, just understand
the syntax and the advantage over the try-finally block:

.. code-block:: python

 with open('workfile', 'r') as f:
     read_data = f.read()
 f.closed
 True


File Writing
------------

.. code-block:: python

    outfile = open('output.txt', 'w')
    for i in range(10):
        outfile.write("this is line: %i\n"%i)
    outfile.close()

    with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
        for i in range(10):
           f.write("this is line: %i\n"%i)


File Methods
------------

Commonly Used Methods:

.. code-block:: python

    f.read() f.readline()  f.readlines()

    f.write(str) f.writelines(seq)

    f.seek(offset)   f.tell() # for binary files, mostly

    f.close()

StringIO
--------

.. code-block:: python

    In [417]: import io
    In [420]: f = io.StringIO()
    In [421]: f.write("somestuff")
    In [422]: f.seek(0)
    In [423]: f.read()
    Out[423]: 'somestuff'
    Out[424]: stuff = f.getvalue()
    Out[425]: f.close()

(This can be handy for testing file handling code...)

There is also cStringIO -- a bit faster.

.. code-block:: python

    from cStringIO import StringIO

Paths and Directories
=====================

Paths
-----

Paths are generally handled with simple strings (or Unicode strings).

Relative paths:

.. code-block:: python

    'secret.txt'
    './secret.txt'

Absolute paths:

.. code-block:: python

    '/home/chris/secret.txt'


Either work with ``open()`` , etc.

(A working directory only makes sense with command-line programs.)

os module
----------

.. code-block:: python

    os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(path)
    os.path.abspath()
    os.path.relpath()


``os.path`` module
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    os.path.split()
    os.path.splitext()
    os.path.basename()
    os.path.dirname()
    os.path.join()


(all platform independent)

Directories
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    os.listdir()
    os.mkdir()
    os.walk()

(Note the ``shutil``  module provides higher level operations.)

pathlib
-------

``pathlib`` is a package for handling paths in an OO way:

http://pathlib.readthedocs.org/en/pep428/

All the stuff in os.path and more:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [64]: import pathlib
    In [65]: pth = pathlib.Path('./')
    In [66]: pth.is_dir()
    Out[66]: True
    In [67]: pth.absolute()
    Out[67]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris/PythonStuff/UWPCE/IntroPython2015')
    In [68]: for f in pth.iterdir():
                 print(f)
    junk2.txt
    junkfile.txt
    ...

And it has a really nifty way to join paths, by overloading the "division" operator:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [49]: p = pathlib.Path.home()  # create a path to the user home dir.

    In [50]: p
    Out[50]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris')

    In [51]: p / "a_dir" / "one_more" / "a_filename"
    Out[51]: PosixPath('/Users/Chris/a_dir/one_more/a_filename')

Kinda slick, eh?

https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

The Path Protocol
-----------------

As of Python 3.6, there is now a protocol for making arbitrary objects act like paths:

Read about it in PEP 519:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0519/

This was added because most built-in file handling modules, as well as any number of third party packages that needed a path, worked only with paths string paths.

Even after ``pathlib`` was added to the standard library, you couldn't pass a ``Path`` object in where a path was needed --even the most common ones like ``open()``.

So you could use the nifty path manipulation stuff, but still needed to call ``str`` on it:

.. code-block:: python

    p = pathlib.Path.home() / a_filename.txt

    f = open(str(p), 'r')

Rather than add explicit support for ``Path`` objects, a new protocol was defined, and most of the standard library was updated to support the new protocol.

This way, third party path libraries could be used with the standard library as well.

What this means to you
----------------------

Unless you are writing a path manipulation library, or a library that deals with paths other than with the stdlib packages (like ``open()``), all you need to know is that you can use ``Path`` objects most places you need a path.

I expect we will see expanded use of pathlib as python 3.6 becomes widely used.

Some added notes:
=================

Using files and "with"
-----------------------

Sorry for the confusion, but I'll be more clear now.

When working with files, unless you have a good reason not to, use ``with``:

.. code-block:: python

  with open(the_filename, 'w') as outfile:
      outfile.write(something)
      do_some_more...
  # now done with out file -- it will be closed, regardless of errors, etc.
  do_other_stuff

``with`` invokes a context manager -- which can be confusing, but for now,
just follow this pattern -- it really is more robust.

And you can even do two at once:

.. code-block:: python

    with open(source, 'rb') as infile, open(dest, 'wb') as outfile:
        outfile.write(infile.read())


Binary files
------------

Python can open files in one of two modes:

 * Text
 * Binary

This is just what you'd think -- if the file contains text, you want text mode. If the file contains arbitrary binary data, you want binary mode.

All data in all files is binary -- that's how computers work. So in Python3, "text" actually means Unicode -- which is a particular system for matching characters to binary data.

But this too is complicated -- there are multiple ways that binary data can be mapped to Unicode text, known as "encodings". In Python, text files are by default opened with the "utf-8" encoding. These days, that mostly "just works".


But if you read a binary file as text, then Python will try to interpret the bytes as utf-8 encoded text -- and this will likely fail:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [13]: open("a_photo.jpg").read()
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-13-5c699bc20e80> in <module>()
    ----> 1 open("PassportPhoto.JPG").read()

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/codecs.py in decode(self, input, final)
        319         # decode input (taking the buffer into account)
        320         data = self.buffer + input
    --> 321         (result, consumed) = self._buffer_decode(data, self.errors, final)
        322         # keep undecoded input until the next call
        323         self.buffer = data[consumed:]

    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte


In Python2, it's less likely that you'll get an error like this -- it doesn't try to decode the file as it's read -- even for text files -- so it's a bit tricky and more error prone.

**NOTE:** If you want to actually DO anything with a binary file, other than passing it around, then you'll need to know a lot about how the details of what the bytes in the file mean -- and most likely, you'll use a library for that -- like an image processing library for the jpeg example above.
