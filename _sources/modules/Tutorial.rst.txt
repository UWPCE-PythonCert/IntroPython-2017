Python Tutorial
===============

This is a tutorial to get you started. Not a lot of explanation,
but enough to get you going with writing basic python code.

This tutorial uses exclusively Python3.

  cited as a great resource, this site offers an entertaining and engaging
  approach and in-browser work.

  This course offers a great foundation for folks who have never
  programmed in any language before. It is, however, only Python2,
  and pretty opinionated about that. But for the most part, you can
  simply add paretheses to ``print()`` and you can get pretty far.

Running Your Code
=================

There are a number of ways to run python code:

- At the interpreter, often referred to as a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print Loop)
- At an enhanced interpreter such as iPython
- In a browser-based interactive system such as the Jupyter Notebook
- From and IDE, such as IDLE or PyCharm
- Calling python from the command line to run a file.

While working with an interactive interpreter can be an excellent way to explore Python (and I highly recommend it), For this tutorial, to get you used to "real" production development, you will write, edit, and save your code in a programmer's text editor, and run it from the command line.

A Programmer's Text Editor
--------------------------

A bit here about an editor, and recommendations on selecting one, with pointers to documentation about editor configuration.

The Python Interpreter
----------------------

Python is a "byte compiled, interpreted" language. What this means to you is that you need a Python interpreter to run your Python code. It also means that that is all you need -- write some code, and run it with Python. That's it.

There are a few Python interpreters (or run-times) available:

- cPython
- PyPy
- Jython
- Iron Python
- MicroPython

These each have their own special uses for interaction the the Java VM or CLR, or running on micro controllers. But most production Python is run with the cPython interpreter, and most people mean cPython when they say "Python".

[link to setting up your environment here]

For this tutorial, you will need cPython version 3.6, installed and running so that when you type "python" at your command line, it starts up:

.. code-block:: bash

  MacBook-Pro:~ Chris$ python
  Python 3.6.2 (v3.6.2:5fd33b5926, Jul 16 2017, 20:11:06)
  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>>

Your result may be slightly different, but it should say Python 3.6. *something* there at the top, and give you the command prompt (``>>>``) at the end.

You can get out of it by typing ctrl+D (on OS_X and Linux) or ctrl+Z (On Windows), or typing ``exit()`` and hitting <return>.

Your first "program"
--------------------

Create your first program by typing this into your text editor::

    print("this worked!")

Type it exactly as above, with no extra space at the beginning, and no other characters.

Save the file as "first.py". Make sure to save it somewhere that makes sense, maybe a directory you create for this purpose, called "tutorial".

Start up the command line ("Terminal" on OS-X, "Command Prompt" on Windows), and "Navigate" to the directory where you just saved that file::

  cd tutorial

Now run your little program, by typing ``python first.py`` and hitting <return>. You should get something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  MacBook-Pro:tutorial Chris$ python first.py
  this worked!
  MacBook-Pro:tutorial Chris$

If this is *NOT* what you got then something went wrong. Some things to check:

 - Did you save the file?
 - Is your command prompt "in" the same directory as the file?
   - you can check this by typing ``ls`` on \*nix, and ``dir`` on Windows, to see what files are in the dir that the command prompt is in.
 - Did you type *exactly* the same line as above?

What did you just do?
.....................

The "python" command starts up the python interpreter. If you "pass in" a file name, by typing the name of the file after "python", then the interpreter will read that file and run any code that is in it.

In this case, python ran the one line of code you put in that file, which told it to print the text: "this worked!" -- and that is what it did.

The print function
------------------

you can display jsut about anything in Python with the ``print()`` function. Simply type::

  print(what you want to print)

examples:

  print(45)
  print("this is a bit of text")

you can print more than one thing by separating them with parentheses::

  print("the value of pi is:", 3.1459, "to two decimal places")

Text in Python
--------------

Text in python is supported by the "str" datatype, which is short for "string". The text datatype is often referred to called "strings" in computer science because it is strings of characters.

In Python3, strings can be any length, and contain any character (even in virtually any language). This is because they support "Unicode" which is a system for representing all the characters of virtually all the languages used on earth.

There are many complications to full support of Unicode, but for the most part, in Python it "just works". Any text you can put in your text editor should work fine.

To create a str, you simply type what you want surrounded by either double or, single quotes (the apostrophe).

Type this in a new file, called ``strings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

  print("This is a basic string")

  print('This is exactly the same string')

  print("You want to use double quotes if there's an apostrophe, like this: ' in the string")

  print('You can use single quotes if you want to "quote" a word')

run the file, and you should get something like this::

  MacBook-Pro:tutorial Chris$ python strings.py
  This is a basic string
  This is exactly the same string
  you want to use double quotes if there's an apostrophe, like this: ' in the string
  and you can use single quotes if you want to "quote" a word

Numbers in Python
-----------------

Python support two types of numbers in Python: integers (int) -- or whole numbers:

.. code-block:: python

  3, 123, -345, 23473948

integers can be negative or positive and as large as you want:

.. code-block:: python

>>> print(12345678987654321234567890987654321234567898765)
12345678987654321234567890987654321234567898765

"real numbers" are called "floating point" (float) numbers. They are internally stored as binary, but you wirte them as regular decimal numbers:

.. code-block:: python

    2.3, 3.0, 3.2459, -23.21

For the most part, Python will convert from integer to floating point numbers for you.

Math
----

Being a computer language, python, of course supports the regular math functions. type the following into a file named math.py and run it:

.. code-block:: python

  print(3)
  print(3 * 4)
  print(3 * 4 + 10 - 2)
  print("twelve divided by 5 is:")
  print(12 / 5)

  print("twelve divided by 5 is:")
  print(12 // 5)

What is the difference between ``12 / 5`` and ``12 // 5`` ?

Order of operations
-------------------

Python follows the standard rules of operator precedence -- which operations are performed first when there are a bunch in a row:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations

Add this to the ``math.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

  print(3 + 4 / 2)

run the file, and see if you get the answer you expect. The result should be 5.0, not 6.0.

That is because multiplication and division are a higher priority than addition, so Python divided 4 by 2 to get 2.0, and then added 3 + 2.0 to get 5.0.

Always keep that in mind when you do math expressions in Python. If you want to change the order of operations, you can group them with parentheses. Add this to the ``math.py`` file and run it:

.. code-block:: python

  print(3 + (4 / 2))
  print((3 + 4) / 2)

Python will always evaluate what is in parentheses first.

Variables
---------

Directly printing things is not all that useful -- though Python does make a good calculator!

Do do anything more complicated, you need to store values to be used later. We do this by "assigning" them to a variable. SAve the follwing in a variables.py file:

.. code-block:: python

    x = 5
    y = 20
    z = x + y

    print("the value of z is", z)

The equals sign: ``=`` is the "assignment operator". It assigns a value to a name, and then when you use the name in the future, Python will replace it with the value it is assigned to when it is used.

names can (and generally should) be long and descriptive, and can contain letters, numbers (but not at the beginning) and some symbols, like the underscore character:

.. code-block:: python

  rectangle_width = 200
  rectangle_height = 23
  rectangle_area = rectangle_width * rectangle_height

Comments
--------

Try running this code:

.. code-block:: python

    print("this")
    # print ("that")
    print("the other")

What does it print?

"that" didn't print because the "#" symbol (the hash) tells python not to run any code after it on that line.

How about this?

.. code-block:: python

    print("this")
    print ("that")  I think we need this line too
    print("the other")

And this?

.. code-block:: python

    # Here we are printing useless stuff:
    print("this")
    print ("that")  # I think we need this line too
    print("the other")

comments can come after running code on a line.
