Lightning Talks
----------------

"Lightning Talks" are a tradition in open-source technical conferences (and maybe others?).  The idea is that people can do a nice, quick talk about a topic of their choice -- much lower pressure than a "real" talk -- but gives folks a chance to show off something they have worked on.

For this class, it's a chance to us to learn a bit about each-other and maybe something new about Python.

**Lightning Talks Requirments**

 * 5 minutes each (including setup) - no kidding!
 * Every student will give one
 * Purposes: introduce yourself, share interests, show Python applications
 * Any topic you like that is related to Python -- according to you!

Schedule the lightning talks:
-----------------------------

* We need to schedule your lightning talks.

* **Let's use Python for that !**

There is a class list in the class repo here:

``examples/session01/students.txt``

Let's write a script to generate a random talk schedule...
