Dictionaries and Sets

Dictionary
==========

Python calls it a ``dict``

Other languages call it:

  * dictionary
  * associative array
  * map
  * hash table
  * hash
  * key-value pair

It is also known in Python as a "mapping", as it "maps" keys to values.

It is like an array, in that it holds a number of items, and you can index into it to get at particular items. But it can use arbitrary indexes, rather than a sequence of numbers.

These indexes are called "keys", and the items stored are called "values".

So for any Python sequence, you might do::

  item = stuff[3]

for a dict, you do::

  item = stuff["third"]

Dictionary Constructors
-----------------------

So how does one make a dict? There are a few ways...

The dict "literal":

.. code-block:: python

    # This dict "lie"
    >>> {'key1': 3, 'key2': 5}
    {'key1': 3, 'key2': 5}

Calling the dict type object constructor:

.. code-block:: python

    # passing in a sequence of (key,value) pairs:
    >>> dict([('key1', 3), ('key2', 5)])
    {'key1': 3, 'key2': 5}

    # passing keys and values as keyword arguments:
    >>> dict(key1=3, key2= 5)
    {'key1': 3, 'key2': 5}

    # creating and empty dict, and then populating it:
    >>> d = {}
    >>> d['key1'] = 3
    >>> d['key2'] = 5
    >>> d
    {'key1': 3, 'key2': 5}

Dictionary Indexing
-------------------

And how do you get stuff out (index it)?

The same way you index a sequence, except the index (now called a key) can be all kinds of stuff:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> d = {'name': 'Brian', 'score': 42}

    >>> d['score']
    42

    >>> d = {1: 'one', 0: 'zero'}

    >>> d[0]
    'zero'

What if the key doesn't exist in the dict?

.. code-block:: python

    >>> d['non-existing key']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    KeyError: 'non-existing key'


What can keys be?
-----------------

Surely not ANYTHING?

Not quite: keys can be any immutable:

  * number
  * string
  * tuple

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [325]: d[3] = 'string'
    In [326]: d[3.14] = 'pi'
    In [327]: d['pi'] = 3.14
    In [328]: d[ (1,2,3) ] = 'a tuple key'

What if you try to use a mutable type?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [329]: d[ [1,2,3] ] = 'a list key'
       TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

Actually -- any "hashable" type.

So, technically, it's not mutability, but hashability that matters.

(Athough for most intents and purposes, you want to use immutable types as keys in dicts.)

Hashing
-------

Hash functions convert arbitrarily large data to a small proxy (usually an int).

They always return the same proxy for the same input.

MD5, SHA, etc, are some well known hash algorithms.

Dictionaries hash the key to an integer proxy and use it to find the key and value.

Key lookup is efficient because the hash function leads directly to a bucket with very few keys (often just one).

What would happen if the proxy (hash) changed after storing a key?

(Answer: you wouldn't be able to find it again!)

Hashability requires immutability.

Key lookup is very efficient:

The access time is constant regardless of the size of the dict.

Dictionary indexing
-------------------

Note: cPython name look-ups are implemented with the dicts -- it's highly optimized.

Key to value:

 * lookup is one way.

Value to key:

 * requires visiting the whole dict.

If you need to check dict values often, create another dict or set.

(But note that it's then up to you to keep them in sync).


Dictionary Ordering (not)
-------------------------

Traditionally, dictionaries have had no defined order. See this example from Python 3.5:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [352]: d = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}
    In [353]: str(d)
    Out[353]: {'one': 1, 'three': 3, 'two': 2}
    In [354]: d.keys()
    Out[354]: dict_keys(['three', 'two', 'one'])

Note how I defined the dict in a natural order, but when it gets printed, or you display the keys, they are in a different order.

However, In cPython 3.6, the internal implementation was changed, and it *does* happen to preserve order. In cPython 3.6, that is considered an implementation detail -- and you should not count on it! However, as of cPython 3.7, dictionaries preserving order will be part of the language specification. This was declared by Guido on the python-dev mailing list on
`Dec 15, 2017 <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html>`

.. code-block:: ipython

    In Python 3.6, the above code results in:

    In [9]: d = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}

    In [10]: str(d)
    Out[10]: "{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}"

    In [11]: d.keys()
    Out[11]: dict_keys(['one', 'two', 'three'])


When new items are added to a dict, they go on the "end":

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: d = {}

    In [13]: d['one'] = 1

    In [14]: d['two'] = 2

    In [15]: d['three'] = 3

    In [16]: str(d)
    Out[16]: "{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}"

and ``dict.popitem()`` will remove the "last" item in the dict.

**CAUTION** This is new behavior in cPython 3.6 -- older versions of Python (notably including Python 2) do not preserve order.  In older versions, there is a special version of a dict in the collections module: ``Collections.OrderedDict`` which preserves order in all versions of Python, and has a couple extra features.


Dictionary Iterating
--------------------

``for``  iterates over the keys

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [23]: d = {'name': 'Brian', 'score': 42}

    In [24]: for x in d:
        ...:     print(x)
        ...:
    name
    score

dict keys and values
--------------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: d = {'name': 'Brian', 'score': 42}

    In [26]: d.keys()
    Out[26]: dict_keys(['name', 'score'])

    In [27]: d.values()
    Out[27]: dict_values(['Brian', 42])

    In [28]: d.items()
    Out[28]: dict_items([('name', 'Brian'), ('score', 42)])

Notice that these are of type ``dict_keys`` and ``dict_values``. These are special types that provide iteration, printing and other features, but are tied to the underlying dict, rather than copies.

(Python2 would simply create lists of keys and values -- but then you were making a copy when you probably didn't need one).


dict keys and values
--------------------

Iterating on everything

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: d = {'name': 'Brian', 'score': 42}

    In [27]: for k, v in d.items():
        print("%s: %s" % (k,v))
       ....:
    name: Brian
    score: 42


Dictionary Performance
-----------------------

  * indexing is fast and constant time: O(1).

  * ``x in s`` constant time: O(1).

  * visiting all is proportional to n: O(n).

  * inserting is constant time: O(1).

  * deleting is constant time: O(1).

Other dict operations:
----------------------

See them all here:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict

Is it in there?

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [5]: d
  Out[5]: {'that': 7, 'this': 5}

  In [6]: 'that' in d
  Out[6]: True

  In [7]: 'this' not in d
  Out[7]: False

Containment is on the keys.

Think of it like a "real" dictionary, where the keys are the words, and the values are the definitions.

Is the word "gullible" in the dictionary? is asking if the key is in the dict.


Getting something: (like indexing)
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [9]: d.get('this')
  Out[9]: 5

But you can specify a default:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [11]: d.get('something', 'a default')
  Out[11]: 'a default'

never raises an Exception (default default is None).


iterating
---------

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [13]: for item in d:
     ....:     print(item)
     ....:
  this
  that

Which is equivalent to, but faster than:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [15]: for key in d.keys():
      print(key)
     ....:
  this
  that

But to get values, you must specify you want values:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [16]: for val in d.values():
      print(val)
     ....:
  5
  7


``pop()``
---------

"Popping": getting the value while removing it.

Pop out a particular key:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [19]: d.pop('this')
  Out[19]: 5

  In [20]: d
  Out[20]: {'that': 7}

pop out an arbitrary key, value pair

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [23]: d.popitem()
  Out[23]: ('that', 7)

  In [24]: d
  Out[24]: {}

This one is handy:

``setdefault(key[, default])``

gets the value if it's there, sets it if it's not.

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [4]: d = {}

  In [5]: d.setdefault('something', 'a value')
  Out[5]: 'a value'

  In [6]: d
  Out[6]: {'something': 'a value'}

The next time you call it, it gets the already set value:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [7]: d.setdefault('something', 'a different value')
  Out[7]: 'a value'


Assignment is a link to the original dict, just like lists or anything else.

And dicts are mutable -- so be careful!

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [47]: d
  Out[47]: {'something': 'a value'}

  In [48]: item_view = d

  In [49]: d['something else'] = 'another value'

  In [50]: item_view
  Out[50]: {'something': 'a value', 'something else': 'another value'}


If you want a copy, use the explicit copy method to get a copy:

.. code-block:: ipython

  In [51] item_copy = d.copy()

  In [52]: d['another thing'] = 'different value'

  In [53]: d
  Out[53]:
  {'another thing': 'different value',
   'something': 'a value',
   'something else': 'another value'}

   In [54]: item_copy
   Out[54]: {'something': 'a value', 'something else': 'another value'}


Sets
====

``set``  is an unordered collection of distinct values.

Essentially a set is a dict with only keys.

Set Constructors:

.. code-block:: ipython

    >>> set()
    set()

    >>> set([1, 2, 3])
    {1, 2, 3}

    >>> {1, 2, 3}
    {1, 2, 3}

    >>> s = set()

    >>> s.update([1, 2, 3])
    >>> s
    {1, 2, 3}


Set Properties
---------------

``Set``  members must be hashable, like dictionary keys -- and for same reason (efficient lookup).

No indexing (unordered).

.. code-block:: ipython

    >>> s[1]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing


Set Methods
-----------

.. code-block:: ipython

    >> s = set([1])
    >>> s.pop() # an arbitrary member
    1
    >>> s.pop()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    KeyError: 'pop from an empty set'
    >>> s = set([1, 2, 3])
    >>> s.remove(2)
    >>> s.remove(2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    KeyError: 2


All the "set" operations from math class...

.. code-block:: python

    s.isdisjoint(other)

    s.issubset(other)

    s.union(other, ...)

    s.intersection(other, ...)

    s.difference(other, ...)

    s.symmetric_difference( other, ...)

Frozen Set
----------

Another kind of set: ``frozenset``

immutable -- for use as a key in a dict (or another set...):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> fs = frozenset((3,8,5))
    >>> fs.add(9)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'

A few added notes:
==================

The count() method
------------------

All Python sequences (including strings) have a ``count()`` method:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: s = "This is an arbitrary string"

    In [2]: s.count('t')
    Out[2]: 2

What if you want a case-insensitive count?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: s.lower().count('t')
    Out[3]: 3

set.update()
------------

If you want to add a bunch of stuff to a set, you can use update:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: s = set()

In [2]: s.update
Out[2]: <function set.update>

In [3]: s.update(['this', 'that'])

In [4]: s
Out[4]: {'that', 'this'}

In [5]: s.update(['this', 'thatthing'])

In [6]: s
Out[6]: {'that', 'thatthing', 'this'}

**NOTE:** It's VERY often the case that when you find yourself writing a trivial loop -- there is a way to do it with a built in method!



Sorting stuff in dictionaries:
-------------------------------

dicts aren't sorted, so what if you want to do something in a sorted way?

The "standard" way:

.. code-block:: python

  for key in sorted(d.keys()):
      ...

Another option:

.. code-block:: python

    collections.OrderedDict

Also other nifty stuff in the ``collections`` module:

https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html

**NOTE:** In Python 3.6, dicts were optimized in a way that happens to preserve order. But this is considered an implementation detail. Do not count on it! If you want order preserved, use OrderedDict.
