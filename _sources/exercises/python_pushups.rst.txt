These are a couple exercises to kick you off with Python

Task 1: Explore Errors
======================

* Create a new directory in your working dir for the class::

  $ mkdir session01
  $ cd session01

* Add a new file to it called ``break_me.py``

* In the ``break_me.py`` file write four simple Python functions:

  * Each function, when called, should cause an exception to happen

  * Each function should result in one of the four most common exceptions you'll find.

  * for review: ``NameError``, ``TypeError``, ``SyntaxError``, ``AttributeError``

(hint -- the interpreter will quit when it hits a Exception -- so you can comment out all but the one you are testing at the moment)

  * Use the Python standard library reference on `Built In Exceptions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html>`_ as a reference


Task 2: Puzzles
===============

To get a bit of exercise solving some puzzles with Python, work on the Python
exercises at "Coding Bat": http://codingbat.com/python

There are 8 sets of puzzles. Do as many as you can, but try to get to at least
the "Warmups".
