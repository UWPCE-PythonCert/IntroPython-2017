Unit Testing and Advanced Argument Passing

Pre-class prep
==============

Reading
-------

Unit Testing
............

* :ref:`unit_testing`

**NOTE:** you will find that most introductions to unit testing with Python use the built in ``unittest`` module. However, it is a bit heavyweight, and requires some knowledge of OOP -- classes, etc. So we'll be using pytest in this class: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/. But the principles of testing are the same.

* Dive into Python: chapter 9:
  http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html

* Ned Batchelder's intro to testing presentation:

Arguments and Parameters

In-class Activities
===================

:ref:`a_bit_on_mutability`

Exercises:
----------

* :ref:`exercise_unit_testing`

* :ref:`exercise_args_kwargs_lab`

Testing mailroom:
.................

:ref:`exercise_mailroom_testing`

Write a complete set of unit tests for your mailroom program.

   * You will likely find that it is really hard to test without refactoring.

   * This is Good!

   * If code is hard to test -- it probably should be refactored.

Post-class Activities
=====================

Finish the exercises

Look at the next session for reading, etc:

:ref:`session_1_07`

NOTE: there is not a lot of new stuff this week, but this will give all of you a chance to catch up if you don't have mailroom and trigrams fully working yet.

And do spend time with the readings (and supplemental readings) -- we are going to dive right in to OO programming next week.
