The Art of Subclassing by *Raymond Hettinger*

http://pyvideo.org/video/879/the-art-of-subclassing

The most salient points from that video are as follows:

* **Subclassing is not for Specialization**

* **Classes and subclassing are for code re-use -- not creating taxonomies**

* **Bear in mind that the subclass is in charge**


Note that the previous talk and this one were back to back at PyCon -- but despite their contradictory titles -- they have similar messages.


Stop Writing Classes
....................

by *Jack Diederich*

http://pyvideo.org/video/880/stop-writing-classes

"If your class has only two methods -- and one of them is ``__init__``
-- you don't need a class"


In-class Activities
===================

review mailman with testing

Exercises:
----------

OO and classes are a big confusing topic when you are new to it.

So we're going to learn hands-on by doing this exercise:

:ref:`exercise_html_renderer`


Post-class Activities
=====================

Finish the HTML render Exercise through step 3.

Look at the next session for reading, etc:
