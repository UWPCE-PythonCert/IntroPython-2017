Handy hints for using git
#########################

git is a very complex system, and can be used in many ways. Because of this, it can be hard to find answers to seemingly simple questions, even though the internet is full of discussions of how to use git.

Every group using git has to establish a standard "work flow". If you google "git workflow" you find a LOT of discussion, and they are not all the same. And depending on the workflow you are using, the problems you'll have and the solutions to them will be different.

We are using a very simplified workflow for this class, and this page seeks to provide solutions to problems that you might encounter specifically with this workflow.

Backing out a change
====================

If you change a file in your repo, and you decide that you simply want to put it back the way it was the last time you committed it -- that's easy::

  git checkout the_name_of_the_file

Backing out a change that has been committed.
---------------------------------------------

Here's the situation:

I accidentally changed a file in the examples dir in my fork of the repo.

Then I committed it, and pushed that commit to gitHub and did a PR.

So how do I back this out?

What you want to do is "checkout" the file from a previous commit.

So the first step is to find a commit that has the correct version of the file.

In this example, the file in question is:

``examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py``

I can use ``git log`` to  figure out when the file was last touched::

    $ git log  examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py

That means: "show me the log of that particular file". ``git log`` by itself will show you the history of the entire repo -- less useful in this case.

In this case, I got::

    $ git log  examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py
    commit 87d27a12bcae5c1bdc565e05e954e7c94bfa27e0 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)

        adding a bit just to test...

    commit 8e5908a37d7df90263057644fef7138e77838107
    Author: Chris Barker <PythonCHB@gmail.com>
    Date:   Sun Nov 5 11:12:06 2017 -0800

        some updates

    commit 4795ddf41f20cfc4346f02319ab61699e8a469f2
    Author: Chris Barker <PythonCHB@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue Oct 31 18:59:31 2017 -0700

        added mailroom review

The entry at the top, from Dec 9th, is the one I want to get rid of, so I want to checkout the version of the file back to the one before that top entry.

Each "commit" is essentially a snapshot of the entire repo when "git commit" was run. Each one is identified by a unique "hash" -- that long string of characters.

To restore a file back to the state in a previous commit, we do::

    git checkout 8e5908a37d7d examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py

And that puts it back to the state it was in at that previous commit, identified by that "hash".

Note that the full hash for each commit is really long, but git will if you use enough characters to uniquely identify it -- ten or so is usually plenty.


``git blame``
=============

``git blame`` is a handy utility for examining the history of a particular part of a particular file. For example:

``git blame -L 2,6 examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py``

That means: "show me the changes to lines 2--6 of this file".

It's called *"blame"* because you can use it to figure out who to blame for a change in a file.

Here's what I got with that example::

    4795ddf4 (Chris Barker 2017-10-31 18:59:31 -0700 2) from os import system
    4795ddf4 (Chris Barker 2017-10-31 18:59:31 -0700 3)
    87d27a12 (Chris Barker 2017-12-09 16:18:22 -0800 4) # some extra in here just to test git
    87d27a12 (Chris Barker 2017-12-09 16:18:22 -0800 5)
    4795ddf4 (Chris Barker 2017-10-31 18:59:31 -0700 6)

So this shows me that it was changed on 12-09, and before that on 10-31. IN this case, I'm the only one that has messed with that file, so no one to shift the blame too :-)


.. _git_branching:

Branching
=========

A really quick intro to branching.

You may want to start with this tutorial to familiarize yourself with the idea:

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches


quick tutorial
--------------

You create a new "branch" with git with the branch command::

    git branch the_name_of_the_branch

where ``the_name_of_the_branch`` is the name of the branch, naturally. To see all the branches you have, you can simply do::

  git branch

The "current" branch or "HEAD" will be marked with an asterix.

To switch to another branch, you can checkout the branch:

    git checkout the_name_of_the_branch

You are now working in the new branch. Anything you commit will be comited to that branch, and no longer effect the master branch.

IF you do a ``git push`` -- you will get a message from git telling you that the branch you are now on is not set up to push to "origin" (your giotHub repo), but it will show you the command you need to set that up -- set-upstream::

  git push --set-upstream origin the_name_of_the_branch

Now it will push to gitHub, and you can see it there.

You can create Pull Requests from that new branch, as well as the old, master, branch.

merging
-------

When you are happy with your work in the new branch, you may want to merge it back into the "master" branch.

Yu can do this by switching to the master branch::

    git checkout master

And then merging your new work into it::

    git merge the_name_of_the_branch

And there you go!

There is a saying in the git world:

    "Branch early, merge often"

It's a good way to work -- branching and merging is easy enough it git that it pays off to do it often.
