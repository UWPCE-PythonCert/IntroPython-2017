Backing out and accidental change in git.

Here's the sitch:

I accidentally changed a file in the examples dir in my fork of the repo.

Then I committed it, and pushed that commit to gitHub and did a PR.

So how do I back this out?

git reset is the key:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215718/reset-or-revert-a-specific-file-to-a-specific-revision-using-git

First step -- find a commit that has the correct version of the file.

The file in question is:

``examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py``

I can use ``git blame`` to  figure out when the file was last touched.

``git blame -L 2,6 examples/Session05/maillroom_test.py``

That means: show me the changes to lines 2--6 of this file. It's called "blame" becasue you can use it to figure out who to blame for a change in a file.

Here's what I got::

    4795ddf4 (Chris Barker 2017-10-31 18:59:31 -0700 2) from os import system
    4795ddf4 (Chris Barker 2017-10-31 18:59:31 -0700 3)
    87d27a12 (Chris Barker 2017-12-09 16:18:22 -0800 4) # some extra in here just to test git
    87d27a12 (Chris Barker 2017-12-09 16:18:22 -0800 5)
    4795ddf4 (Chris Barker 2017-10-31 18:59:31 -0700 6)

So this shows me that it was changed on 12-09, and before that on 10-31. The 12-09 change
