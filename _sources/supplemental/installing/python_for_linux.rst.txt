Setting Up Linux for Python
***************************


==================================================
Debian and Related Distros (Ubuntu, Linux Mint)
==================================================

Python
-------

Debian distros already have the stable python2 and python3 releases preinstalled (`Debian Wiki <https://wiki.debian.org/Python>`_).

Try the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python2
  Python 2.7.9 (default, April 2 2015, 15:33:32)
  [GCC 4.9.2 on linux2]
  >>>

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python3
  Python 3.4.3 (default, March 26 2015, 15:33:32)
  [GCC 4.9.2 on linux]
  >>>

I'm pretty sure that 16.4 (the most recent long term support release) has 3.5

That's nice, which one is the default version? Just type ``python`` to see. It's probably python2 still:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python
  Python 2.7.9 (default, April 2 2015, 15:33:32)
  [GCC 4.9.2 on linux2]
  >>>

If you want to make ``python3.5`` the default version then add the line ``alias python=python3`` to your user's ``/home/{user}/.bashrc`` file like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ # before the change
  $ python
  Python 2.7.9 (default, April 2 2015, 15:33:32)
  [GCC 4.9.2 on linux2]
  >>>

  $ echo "alias python=python3" >> ~/.bashrc
  $ source ~/.bashrc

  $ # after the change
  $ python
  Python 3.5.2 (default, March 26 2015, 15:33:32)
  [GCC 4.9.2 on linux]
  >>>

If you don't have the version you want installed then use the package manager to find and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ # search the package manager for it
   $ sudo apt-cache search python | grep '^python3.5\ -'
   python3.5 - Interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 3.5)
   $ # install it
   $ sudo apt-get install python3.5


Terminal
---------

Every Linux box has a terminal emulator -- find and use it.



pip
---

``pip`` is the Python package installer.

Many Python packages are also available directly from your distro -- but you'll get the latest and greatest if you use ``pip`` to install it instead.

To get pip, the first option is to use your system package manager, something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

If that doesn't work, then look up the `official manual install notes <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_

Using pip:
----------

To use pip to install a package, you invoke it with this command::

  python -m pip install the_name_of_the_package

Where ``python`` is the command you use to invoke the Python you want to use (could be ``python3``)

**NOTE:** You will frequently see advice to use pip like so::

  $ pip install something_or_other

Which often works, but also can invoke the *wrong* version of pip. The above command::

  $ python -m pip install something_or_other

calls Python, and tells it to run the ``pip`` module. It is exactly the same as calling pip directly, except that you are assured that you are getting the version of pip connected the version of python that you are running.

iPython
--------

One extra package we are going to use in class is ``iPython``::

  $ sudo python3 -m pip install ipython[all]

You should now be able to run ``iPython``::

  $ ipython3
  Python 3.5.2 ()
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

  IPython 2.0.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
  ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
  %quickref -> Quick reference.
  help      -> Python's own help system.
  object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

git
----

Git is likely to be there on your system already, but if not:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install git

==================================================
Fedora and Red Hat Related Distros (CentOS)
==================================================

.. warning::

	CentOS is probably the most popular distro of these related flavors. However, getting Python3 on it can be a pain. You have been warned!


Python
-------

Fedora distros already have the stable python2 and python3 releases preinstalled `[2] <Fedora Wiki>`_. However, CentOS, the most popular distro only has the stable python2 release. Try the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

	[centos@ip-172-31-21-5 ~]$ python2
	Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
	[GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-16)] on linux2
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>>

	[centos@ip-172-31-21-5 ~]$ python3
	-bash: python3: command not found


Let's install python3 using the package manager. Step one install "Software Collections" to help us:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo yum -y install scl-utils

Then go to the `software collections listing <https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/>`_ and click on the Python collection version you want to install.

Probably this one:

https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-python35/


Note, you also need to know which version of CentOS you are using (probably 6 or 7). For example, we care about `python version 3.5` so let's go the `.rpm` i want to install `here <https://www.softwarecollections.org/repos/rhscl/rh-python35/epel-7-x86_64/noarch/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ # add this package to the rpm package manager
	$ sudo rpm -Uvh https://www.softwarecollections.org/repos/rhscl/rh-python34/epel-7-x86_64/noarch/rhscl-rh-python35-epel-7-x86_64.noarch.rpm

	$ # install the right python version
	$ sudo yum install rh-python35

When you want to use python3 run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

	[centos@ip-172-31-21-5 ~]$ scl enable rh-python35 bash


Terminal
---------

Every Linux box has a terminal emulator -- find and use it.


git
----

Git is likely to be there on your system already, but if not:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo yum install git

pip
---

``pip`` is the Python package installer.

Many Python packages are also available directly from your distro -- but you'll get the latest and greatest if you use ``pip`` to install it instead.

In CentOS, if you used the above technique to install Python3, then it comes with pip. Try:

.. code-block:: bash

	[centos@ip-172-31-21-5 ~]$ python -m pip -V
	pip 8.1.2 from /opt/rh/rh-python35/root/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)

Using pip:
----------

To use pip to install a package, you invoke it with this command::

  python -m pip install the_name_of_the_package

Where ``python`` is the command you use to invoke the Python you want to use (could be `python3`)

**NOTE:** You will frequently see advice to use pip like so::

  $ pip install something_or_other

Which often works, but also can invoke the *wrong* version of pip. The above command::

  $ python -m pip install something_or_other

calls Python, and tells it to run the ``pip`` module. It is exactly the same as calling pip directly, except that you are assured that you are getting the version of pip connected the version of python that you are running.

iPython
--------

One we are going to use in class is ``iPython``::

  $ sudo pip install ipython[all]

You should now be able to run ``iPython``::

    $ ipython3
	Python 3.5.2 ()
	Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

	IPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
	?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
	%quickref -> Quick reference.
	help      -> Python's own help system.
	object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.
