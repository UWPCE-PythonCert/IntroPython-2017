git Overview
============

git is a very complex and powerful system. However, it can be very useful even if you only use a small portion of its functionality. This page should be bring you up to speed enough to make good use of git for the Python Certificate class.

Note that in the certificate program we will be using git in conjunction with gitHub, a cloud-based service that provides a collaboration environment for software development based on the git version control system.

gitHub provides a web service and web interface that hosts projects and supports collaboration among teams and the open source community. It adds other features, but is very much built on the source control system, git. So a basic understanding of git is required to make proper use of gitHub.

A Picture of git

    A git repository is a set of points in time, with history showing where
    you've been.

    Each point has a *name* (here *A*, *B*, *C*) that uniquely identifies it,
    called a *hash*.

    Note: To those computer geeks among us -- yes, this an actual hash of ALL the files in the repo at that point in time -- so it uniquely identifies the *exact* state. That is why it's a long ugly set of seemingly random characters. But when using git, all you need to know is that it is a name that identifies that unique state.

    The path from one point to the previous is represented by the *difference*
    between the two points.


.. figure:: /_static/git_head.png
    :width: 75%
    :class: center

.. container::

    Each point in time can also have a label that points to it.

    One of these is *HEAD*, which always points to the place in the timeline
    that you are currently looking at.


.. figure:: /_static/git_master_branch.png
    :width: 75%
    :class: center

.. container::

    You may also be familiar with the label "master".

    This is the name that git automatically gives to the first *branch* in a
    repository.

    A *branch* is actually just a label for a certain set of points in time.


.. figure:: /_static/git_new_commit.png
    :width: 75%
    :class: center

.. container::

    When you make a *commit* in git, you add a new point to the timeline.

    The HEAD label moves to this new point.

    So does the label for the *branch* you are on.

    A lot of terms in git are "overloaded" - used in multiple ways. For instance, the verb "commit" is the act of committing the state of your files to git -- saving that state so you can go back to it later.

    The noun "commit" is a particular state of the repository -- it has been saved and has particular name (hash) -- it is one if the points on that timeline.



.. figure:: /_static/git_new_branch.png
    :width: 75%
    :class: center

.. container::

    You can make a new *branch* with the ``branch`` command.

    This adds a new label to the current commit.

    Notice that it *does not* check out that branch -- you will still be working in the current branch.


.. figure:: /_static/git_checkout_branch.png
    :width: 75%
    :class: center

.. container::

    You can use the ``checkout`` command to switch to the new branch.

    This associates the HEAD label with the *session01* label.

    Use ``git branch`` to see which branch is *active*::

        $ git branch
          master
        * session01


.. figure:: /_static/git_commit_on_branch.png
    :width: 75%
    :class: center

.. container::

    While it is checked out, new commits move the *session01* label.

    Notice that HEAD is *always* the same as "where you are now"


You can use this to switch between branches and make changes in isolation.

    Branching allows you to keep related sets of work separate from each-other.

    In our lessons, you can use it to do each of your exercises.

    Simply create a new branch for each session from your repository master
    branch.

    Do your work on that branch, and then you can issue a **pull request** in
    github to have your work evaluated.

    This is very much like how teams work in the "real world" so learning it
    here will help you.

    The final step in the process is merging your work.


The ``merge`` command allows you to *combine* your work on one branch with the
work on another.

.. container::

    It creates a new commit which reconciles the differences:

    .. figure:: /_static/git_merge_commit.png
        :width: 75%
        :class: center

    Notice that this commit has **two** parents.



.. container::

    Sometimes when you ``merge`` two branches, you get *conflicts*.

    This happens when the same file was changed in about the same place in two
    different ways.

    Often, git can work these types of things out on its own, but if not,
    you'll need to manually edit files to fix the problem.

    You'll be helped by the fact that git will tell you which files are in
    conflict.

    Just open those files and look for conflict markers:

        * <<<<<<<<< *hash1* (stuff from the current branch)
        * ========= (the pivot point between two branches' content)
        * >>>>>>>>> *hash2* (stuff from the branch being merged)


Your job in fixing a conflict is to decide exactly what to keep.

You can (and should) communicate with others on your team when doing this.

Always remember to remove the conflict markers too.  They are not syntactic
code in any language and will cause errors.

Once a conflict is resolved, you can ``git add`` the file back and then commit
the merge.
