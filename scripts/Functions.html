<p>Functions - Introduction
With Rick Riehle</p>
<p>[Requires: feed to laptop.]</p>
<p>We’ve seen some of the basic building blocks of programs such as basic data structures, conditional flow control statements like ‘if’ and looping constructs such as ‘while’ and ‘for’.    We can do quite a lot with these constructs alone.</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about what your programs would look like using only these constructs.    If you’re relatively new to programming this should be easy.    If you’ve been around for awhile, you may need to forget some of what you already know for this thought experiment to work.</p>
<p>Using only the basic building blocks you start at the top of your program and work your way to the bottom.    You likely define a few variables early on.    From there you might have an ‘if’ statement that conditionally executes one code block rather than some other code block.   Beyond that perhaps you iterate over a list with a ‘for’ loop.    Maybe you load data from a database into a list of tuples and iterate over those, printing the interesting bits.</p>
<p>Think about this in its general form.    Where does execution begin and where does it end?  What happens if you find yourself repeating the same code, the same series of statements, in several ‘while’ or ‘for’ loops?  What happens if you need to change the code in one of the loops, say in response to a change in the fields returned from your database, yet forget to change the corresponding code in all of the loops?</p>
<p>Without a higher level construct to help organize code you have something closer to a script than a program.   Scripts are common in the automation of systems-level tasks, the type of programming used regularly by Sysadmins and Devops Developers.    They run top to bottom and are good for simple, concise tasks.    To move beyond scripts we need functions.</p>
<p>[Stop the video, take a breath, prep.]</p>
<p>[On screen: Basic Function Definition]</p>
<p>The basic form of a function is a ‘def’ statement, followed by the name of the function, followed by an argument list and finally a colon.    All of this is typically on the first line of the function definition.    Then within the function are all of the statements and expressions that do the work of the function and finally a return value.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def addOne(x):</dt>
<dd>result = x + 1
return result</dd>
</dl>
<p>In simple cases, all of the work of the function can be done on the return line, which eliminates a name – in this case ‘result’ – and makes the function easier to read.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def addOne(x):</dt>
<dd>return x + 1</dd>
</dl>
<p>[On screen: Arguments]</p>
<p>Functions can take more than a single argument.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def add(x, y):</dt>
<dd>return x + y</dd>
<dt>def add(x, y, z):</dt>
<dd>return x + y + z</dd>
</dl>
<p>Functions can have default values for arguments so that the caller can neglect to specify certain arguments and yet get reasonable defaults.</p>
<p>def add(x, y=0, z=0):
return x + y + z</p>
<p>add(3)
3</p>
<p>add(3, 2)
5</p>
<p>add(3, 2, 1)
6</p>
<p>We snuck in an interesting and useful feature of functions in Python: keyword arguments which are often called kwargs for short.    The second and third arguments to our function above have names.   The first named or keyword argument is ‘y’ and the second is ‘z’.    Note that the act of giving default values to arguments turns them from standard positional arguments into keyword arguments.    This allows the caller to specify them by name rather than by position so that they can be called in any order.    For instance, ‘z’ can be specified before ‘y’.</p>
<p>add(0, z=1, y=2)
3</p>
<p>Kwargs also allow the caller to skip unneeded arguments and rely instead on their defaults.</p>
<p>add(0, z=1)
1</p>
<p>Note however, that positional arguments cannot be skipped.   In this simple case we have only one positional argument ‘x’ which Python will not permit us to ignore.</p>
<div class="section" id="add-y-2-z-3">
<h2>add(y=2, z=3)<a class="headerlink" href="#add-y-2-z-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call     last)
&lt;ipython-input-18-5b53a9942d6b&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
—-&gt; 1 add(y=2, z</p>
<p>TypeError: add() missing 1 required positional argument: ‘x’</p>
<p>[On screen: Return Values]</p>
<p>Functions can also take zero arguments, just define with them with nothing between the parenthesis for the argument list.</p>
<p>Functions can also return nothing.   If you leave off the return statement it will return nothing – or None – to its caller.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def sayHello():</dt>
<dd>print(“Hello”)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Interestingly, in Python functions can return more than a single value.    They can return two, three, four, or indeed an arbitrary number of values.    To do this, place commas between the values you plan to return.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def giveMeTwoValues():</dt>
<dd>return 1, “two”</dd>
</dl>
<p>first, second = giveMeTwoValues()</p>
<p>first
1</p>
<p>second
‘two’</p>
<p>Give the return value a single name, and the objects will be packed into a tuple and each object in the tuple can be accessed according to its position.</p>
<p>myTwoValues = giveMeTwoValues()</p>
<p>myTwoValues
(1, ‘two’)</p>
<p>type(myTwoValues)
tuple</p>
<p>myTwoValues[0]
1</p>
<p>myTwoValues[1]
‘two’</p>
<p>type(myTwoValues[0])
int</p>
<p>type(myTwoValues[1])
str</p>
<p>[On screen: Scope]</p>
<p>Functions can carry variables that come into existence and go out of existence during the run of the function.    This is known as scope.    It would be just as correct to say that these variables come into scope and go out of scope during the run of the function.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def my_func(x=1):</dt>
<dd>a = “alpha”
b = “beta”
return a*x, b*x</dd>
</dl>
<p>my_func()
(‘alpha’, ‘beta’)</p>
<p>my_func(2)
(‘alphaalpha’, ‘betabeta’)</p>
<p>Variables that are defined within a function are called local variables, because they are local to the function.    Note that once the function has completed executing, its local variables are no longer in scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a">
<h2>a<a class="headerlink" href="#a" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-4-3f786850e387&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
—-&gt; 1 a</p>
<p>NameError: name ‘a’ is not defined</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="b">
<h2>b<a class="headerlink" href="#b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-5-89e6c98d9288&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
—-&gt; 1 b</p>
<p>NameError: name ‘b’ is not defined</p>
<p>Python’s scoping rules are such that any variables outside the function with the same names are masked by local variables.   In other words, if ‘a’ and ‘b’ are defined outside the function, they don’t interfere with the variables inside the function.</p>
<p>a = “apple”</p>
<p>b = “banana”</p>
<p>my_func(2)
(‘alphaalpha’, ‘betabeta’)</p>
<p>‘my_func’ still returns alphas and betas rather than apples and bananas.</p>
<p>While we are still on the topic of scope, and which names are available when, let’s take the example above and put it into an executable python file or a script.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def my_func(x=1):</dt>
<dd>a = “alpha”
b = “beta”
return a*x, b*x</dd>
</dl>
<p>a = “apple”</p>
<p>b = “banana”</p>
<p>Look at the structure  of that code, its physical layout.    Notice how certain elements are indented under others.    Notice that some are not indented at all, but rather sit along the left margin of the file.    This is meaningful.    The indented elements are only in scope within their enclosing blocks.   Python is very explicit about this: indentation is meaningful.    When Python was first created this was one of its most controversial features.    Other languages used syntactic elements like parentheses, brackets and semicolons to indicate structure.    Python dispensed with most of that, and some people like it and some people don’t.    The purpose is so that programmers, at a glance, have clear visual clues as to what is related to what.    Clues as to which symbols are in scope and when.    Python also has a rigorous style guide called PEP8 which we will refer to regularly during the class.    Other languages also recognize how useful these visual clues can be, and so now most code editors have auto-formatting features which follow conventions, conventions like PEP8, about how code should be laid out for whatever language you happen to be working in.    One nice effect of this is that as you spend more and more time with the language, the details of its syntax tend to fade into the background which allows you as the programmer to pay more attention to the problem you are trying to solve.   Just as with a written language such as English or Spanish, after awhile you hardly see the syntax and you just focus on the words and their meaning.    The conventions around paragraph indentation give you clues about where one idea ends and another begins.   So it is with computer code, especially Python.</p>
<p>Python3 has two keywords for controlling scope: ‘global’ and ‘nonlocal’.   In a sense they are for breaking the scoping rules and conventions we’ve talked about.   Don’t worry about them for now.    Know they’re there, and know that you can use them as a lazy way to get out of a tight spot.
[On screen: Summary]</p>
<p>Now think back to our thought experiment from when we started.    How could the use of functions improve the way we construct programs?  Perhaps most significantly we can now reduce code redundancy by factoring out repetitive code blocks and instead using functions which can be called from wherever in our program they are needed.    Moreover where once we had to work strictly from the top of our program to the bottom, we can now construct a series of functions that can be called from a main routine or from higher level functions making our program more readable.</p>
