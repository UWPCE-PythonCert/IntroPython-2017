Oh, I'm being eaten
By a boa constrictor
A boa constrictor
A boa constrictor
I'm being eaten by a boa constrictor
And I don't like it one bit.
Well, what do you know
It's nibblin' my toe.
Oh gee,
It's up to my knee.
Oh my,
It's up to my thigh.
Oh fiddle,
It's up to my middle.
Oh heck,
It's up to my neck.
Oh dread,
It's upmmmmmmmmmfffff.
