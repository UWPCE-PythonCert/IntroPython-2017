# A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter,
# and the user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.

# Other abilities of a Circle instance:

# Compute the circleâ€™s area
# Print the circle and get something nice
# Be able to add two circles together
# Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger
# Be able to compare to see if there are equal
# (follows from above) be able to put them in a list and sort them
