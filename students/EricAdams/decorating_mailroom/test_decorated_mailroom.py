unit tests for the classes in the mailroom program

$ pytest

will run the tests.

$ pytest py.test --cov=mailroom test_mailroom.py

will run the tests and show a coverage report.

$ pytest --cov=mailroom --cov-report html test_mailroom.py

will generate an html report.

NOTE: when I first ran it, I got 97% coverage -- it was missing tests
      of creating a Donor and DonorDB empty.

      This prompted me to write tests for these, and then I discoverd
      that I got an error when you tried to get the last_donation from
      a Donor that did not have any donations.

      A win for testing!
